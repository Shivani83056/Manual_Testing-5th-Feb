Introduction

This project focuses on the manual testing of a web application to ensure its functionality, usability, and performance meet the required standards. The testing process involves creating detailed test plans, executing test cases, identifying defects, and reporting findings systematically.

Project Type

Manual Testing

Deliverables

The following artifacts have been created as part of this project:

Test Plan - A structured document outlining the testing scope, objectives, methodology, schedule, and resources.

Test Cases - A comprehensive set of test cases covering various functionalities and user scenarios.

Defect Report - A detailed record of defects found during testing, including severity, priority, and reproduction steps.

Test Execution Report - Documentation of test execution results, status, and pass/fail outcomes.

XMind Report - A mind map representation of the testing process, including test scenarios, defects, and improvements.

Presentation (PPT) - A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the testing process, findings, and key takeaways.
